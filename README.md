# eCommerce Site Back End

## Description
This CLI project allows the user to create a professional eCommerce site with proper routes and a database to store all products. The project requires Node.js, an environment file and .gitignore, along with mySQL and Insomnia or Postman for the application to run successfully. When the user accesses the project through the CLI, and has the proper packages installed, the user can enter the command "node server.js" into the terminal which will allow the server to start running on a local port.
